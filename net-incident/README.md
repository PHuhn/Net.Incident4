# Net-Incident

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).  Net-Incident was first built as an Angular 4 application and is currently built with Angular 15.

## About Net-Incident

Given classified incident logs (like SQL injection, XSS or PHP vulnerabilities), this application groups the incidents by IP address, lookup the ISP abuse email address, ISP name and NIC (Network Information Center). Can generate an email message via the incident type template.  If mail is configured in the back-end server, it will send the message to the ISPâ€™s abuse email address.

## Construction

Is an Angular CLI application that uses the following PrimeFaces PrimeNG library components:
* p-table,
* p-ComfirmDialog,
* p-dialog (window/popup),
* pButton (directive),
* p-menubar (menu),
* p-dropdown.

The app-component is the conventional root component. The component structure is as follows:

* app-component
  * app-alerts
  * router-outlet (app-routing.module)
  * p-confirmDialog
  * app-header
    * p-menubar
      * app-about
      * app-contact
      * app-help
  * app-login
    * app-server-selection-window (p-dialog)
  * app-incident-grid (p-table)
    * app-server-selection-window (p-dialog)
    * app-incident-detail-window (p-dialog)
    * app-incident-note-grid (p-table)
      * app-incident-note-detail-window (p-dialog)
    * app-networklog-grid (p-table)

Good design practices inherit the components from an application specific class.  This application's base component contains two methods that constantly appeared in the code.

*	baseDeleteConfirm
*	baseErrorHandler

In addition the application has two custom services:

* alert.service
* console-log.service

# Angular CLI Applications

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` or `ng test --code-coverage` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running lint

Run `ng lint` to execute [es-lint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
